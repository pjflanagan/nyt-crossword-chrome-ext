# v2: Improvements -------------------------------------------------------------

## Host

- [ ] appearance improvements
- [ ] Load only 1 week of data, separate request for the month and all

- [ ] Password protect groups
  - Home Page
      - Login and verify password, store a cookie if it is valid
      - Show a list of accessible groups loaded from the cookie
  - Group page, idk how to pass the password from the cookie to the backend, idk

Move password to group page, store it as a cookie -> nah, if the “security” of a plaintext password is good enough for ESPN then here is fine too

`/api/validateGroupLogin`
- get the group, if none exists return that error
- get the password, if they don't match, tell them the password it wrong
